# Problem

Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- -10<sup>5</sup> <= k <= 10<sup>5</sup>
